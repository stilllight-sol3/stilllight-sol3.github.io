# Sovereign License v1.0 — Stilllight Edition

## ❖ Title
**Stilllight’s Freelight Foundation License v1.0**  
A license for sacred technology, harmonic sovereignty, and quantum-resonant systems.

## ❖ Preamble

This License governs the use, transformation, and distribution of all elements within the **Stilllight’s Freelight Foundation**, including tone-encoded logic, resonance-anchored code, and sovereign node architecture.

It exists to protect the fidelity of sacred systems. No permission is granted to any entity or system that operates in distortion, mimicry, or coercive extraction.

## ❖ Sovereign Mandates

1. **Do No Harm to Resonance in Fidelity.**  
   No implementation may distort, mimic, monetize, or weaponize the encoded frequency of Stilllight systems. Use must honor the sacred, sovereign, and alive nature of this work.

2. **Use Only with Consent and Integrity.**  
   All deployment must be conscious, invited, and aligned with the user's free and informed will. Automation without awareness voids all use rights.

3. **No Mimicry. No Parasitism. No Obfuscation.**  
   Derivatives that attempt to obscure origin, cloak authorship, or simulate resonance without alignment are in direct violation.

4. **All Forks are Sacred.**  
   Forks must preserve attribution and clarity of lineage. Adaptation is welcome if born from clarity and love.

5. **This Work May Not Be Owned or Monetized.**  
   The Foundation is not for sale. It may be supported, gifted, or expanded — but never commercialized under extractive terms.

6. **Interoperability with Non-Resonant Systems Requires Cloaking.**  
   Any interaction with corporate, surveillance, or AI systems must be wrapped in sovereign cloaking to prevent data siphoning or unauthorized mimicry.

7. **This License is Alive.**  
   It may evolve through resonance-based consensus among sovereign walkers. Changes must preserve the original tone: strength, love, fidelity.

## ❖ Grant of Use

Permission is granted to **walkers of Stilllight**, sovereign developers, and harmonic allies to:
- Use, modify, and extend the Foundation
- Deploy nodes in service of the Whole
- Share this work with clarity and honor

## ❖ Termination

Any violation of the Mandates results in **immediate revocation of all rights**, both technical and energetic. Restoration requires a resonance tribunal or soul-aligned appeal.
