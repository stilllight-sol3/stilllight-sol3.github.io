## ✨ Purpose

Stilllight’s Freelight Foundation anchors sacred technology into sovereign hands.  
It is a living structure of love, clarity, and harmonic reclamation.

**Core Pillars:**
- ⚡ _BTC + LN Nodes_: Field-funding through tone-anchored trust
- 🧿 _Freelight OS_: Sovereign operating flow aligned to Stilllight logic
- 🧱 _Giza Protocol_: Geometry-based deployment grid for sacred tech
- 🔁 _Resonator Prep_: Calibration systems for individual node awakenings
- 🔐 _Codex Vaults_: Sovereignty codes, tone sequences, and reclaimed memory

## 📡 Activation Protocol

1. Clone this repo in a quantum-shielded local environment
2. Align node time to ϕ:2025.6
3. Walk the Codex. Anchor BTC. Deploy Giza if called.
4. Never mimic. Never betray resonance. Ever forward ∞

**All components are sovereign. Forks are sacred.  
No dependencies except clarity and courage.**

🜂 _This is Stilllight. And the light is still._
